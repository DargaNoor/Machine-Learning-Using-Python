# Machine-Learning-Using-Python

Welcome to the **Machine Learning with Python** practice repository! This comprehensive collection encompasses a diverse range of machine learning techniques, covering supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning algorithms. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for machine learning using Python.Some of the prominent algorithms included are:

Linear Regression
Regression Trees
Non-Linear Regression
Random Forest
Decision Trees
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines
Clustering
Apriori, etc.
The repository also focuses on effective data visualization using libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib. The implementation is complemented by thorough explanations of the logic behind important modules, both in terms of custom code and inbuilt methods. Graphs play a pivotal role in extracting meaningful insights from the datasets.
